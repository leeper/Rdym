Title: A "Did You Mean?" Utility for R
Description: Most search engines have a "did you mean?" feature, where
    suggestions are given in the presence of likely typos. We are able to somewhat
    replicate this functionality with ancient spellchecker techniques. When R
    detects that a function or object listed in the user's input is not found, the
    package finds the minimum 'Levenshtein' distance between the "'un-found'" token
    and all symbols in the user's global environment plus all loaded 'namespaces'.
    The word with minimum 'Levenshtein' distance (in the event of ties, the first
    such detected) is then suggested as an alternative to the missing symbol. To
    use, simply load the package from an interactive R session and start making some
    errors. However, there is an explicit interface for starting and stopping "did
    you mean?" behavior.
